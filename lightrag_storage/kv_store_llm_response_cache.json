Гладких , П.В. Трусов Пермский национальный исследовательский политехнический университет , Пермь , Российская Федерация О СТАТЬЕ АННОТАЦИЯ Получена : 14 августа 2023 Одобрена : 06 сентября 2023 Принята к публикации : 11 сентября 2023 В процессах обработки металлов и сплавов для получения готовых изделий существенно меняется внутренняя структура и зависящие от нее свойства различ - ных масштабных уровней материала , прогнозирование которых с применением эмпирических методов чрезвычайно затратно . По этой причине разработка техноло - гий обработки немыслима без математических моделей , центральным элементом которых является определяющие соотношения . Перспективным для построения последних является физический подход , по- зволяющий описывать эволюцию внутренней структуры на различных масштабных уровнях . Как правило , такие модели материалов являются многоуровневыми и представляют целый класс конститутивных моделей . Отдельный интерес представляют упругопластические модели , так как позво - ляют проводить расчеты с достаточно большими шагами по времени . Большинство моделей этого типа основаны на модели Тейлора – Бишопа – Хилла , но они имеют недостаток : неопределенность в выборе набора активных систем скольжения . В данной работе исследуется влияние случайного выбора наборов активных систем скольжения в упругопластических моделях типа Тейлора – Бишопа – Хилла на результаты моделирования деформирования поликристаллов . Показано , что с ростом деформаций случайный выбор наборов активных систем скольжения при- водит к практически монотонному увеличению различий при расчете тензора на- пряжений макроуровня и углов разориентации между зернами . Данный факт озна - чает , что присущая указанным моделям проблема неопределенности оказывает влияние на результаты моделирования . Это свидетельствует о необходимости разработки алгоритма , позволяющего устранить отмеченную неопределенность , что составляет предмет готовящейся публикации авторов . © ПНИПУФинансирование Работа выполнена при финансо - вой поддержке Минобр России в рамках выполнения государст - венного задания в лаборатории многоуровневого моделирования конструкционных и функциональ - ных материалов , проект № FSNM-2021-0012.

Гладких , П.В. Трусов Пермский национальный исследовательский политехнический университет , Пермь , Российская Федерация О СТАТЬЕ АННОТАЦИЯ Получена : 14 августа 2023 Одобрена : 06 сентября 2023 Принята к публикации : 11 сентября 2023 В процессах обработки металлов и сплавов для получения готовых изделий существенно меняется внутренняя структура и зависящие от нее свойства различ - ных масштабных уровней материала , прогнозирование которых с применением эмпирических методов чрезвычайно затратно . По этой причине разработка техноло - гий обработки немыслима без математических моделей , центральным элементом которых является определяющие соотношения . Перспективным для построения последних является физический подход , по- зволяющий описывать эволюцию внутренней структуры на различных масштабных уровнях . Как правило , такие модели материалов являются многоуровневыми и представляют целый класс конститутивных моделей . Отдельный интерес представляют упругопластические модели , так как позво - ляют проводить расчеты с достаточно большими шагами по времени . Большинство моделей этого типа основаны на модели Тейлора – Бишопа – Хилла , но они имеют недостаток : неопределенность в выборе набора активных систем скольжения . В данной работе исследуется влияние случайного выбора наборов активных систем скольжения в упругопластических моделях типа Тейлора – Бишопа – Хилла на результаты моделирования деформирования поликристаллов . Показано , что с ростом деформаций случайный выбор наборов активных систем скольжения при- водит к практически монотонному увеличению различий при расчете тензора на- пряжений макроуровня и углов разориентации между зернами . Данный факт озна - чает , что присущая указанным моделям проблема неопределенности оказывает влияние на результаты моделирования . Это свидетельствует о необходимости разработки алгоритма , позволяющего устранить отмеченную неопределенность , что составляет предмет готовящейся публикации авторов . © ПНИПУФинансирование Работа выполнена при финансо - вой поддержке Минобр России в рамках выполнения государст - венного задания в лаборатории многоуровневого моделирования конструкционных и функциональ - ных материалов , проект № FSNM-2021-0012.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state \"Description not available in text.\"\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4.
